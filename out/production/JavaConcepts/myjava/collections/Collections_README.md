## Concepts
* [ArrayList](#arraylist)
* [LinkedList](#linkedlist)
## Random Notes
* ArrayList is better to access data whereas LinkedList is better to manipulate data. Both classes implements List interface.
* ### ArrayList
  * ArrayList has developed with the concept of Dynamic array.
  * Index starts from 0.
  * Initial size of any array list would always be 10 at the time of creation given the 
    condition that the size of the array list is less than or equal to 10, If the size 
    exceeds the limit it always increments the size by 50%.
  * ArrayList provides constant time for search operation, so it is better to use ArrayList 
    if searching is more frequent operation than add and remove operation.
* ### LinkedList
  * LinkedList has developed with the concept of Double linked list.
  * The LinkedList provides constant time for add and remove operations. So it is better to use 
    LinkedList for manipulation.
