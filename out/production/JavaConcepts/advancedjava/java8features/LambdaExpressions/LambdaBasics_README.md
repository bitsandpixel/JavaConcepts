# Lambda Basics

* WHY Lambdas
    * Enables Functional Programming
    * Readable and concise code(eliminates boilerplate code)
    * Enables us to write better and easier-to-use APIs and libraries
    * Enables support for parallel processing
    
* Functional Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming
    * Functional programming let us write better, readable and maintainable code.
    * Problems with Object-Oriented Programming
        * Everything is an object
        * All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects.
