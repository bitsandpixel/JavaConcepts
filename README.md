## General Information

```
 A Project where I try to explain as much as I can about Java(Personal storage of concepts for myself and 
 anyone who finds it)
 
 Each of the "Demo code" I have provided is at an elementary level along with developer comments and an explanation 
 of concept either in the class file or in a README file of a related package.
```

* This is a project I am creating to revise java concepts and to refer whenever I needed to brush up any concept of java
  in the future. If it helps anyone else and If anyone likes to contribute, I gladly welcome them. Note: I am starting
  to shape the project based on below mentioned links, at least in the beginning stage of the project, I would always
  add the links I have referred.

* I have divided the project into two main packages which themselves have child packages based on the different areas
  covered in the project.
    * myjava
    * advancedjava

## When to use?

```
Here I would try to document which concept of java would be suitable for the real life scenario.
//TODO: when to use array, arraylist, linkedlist??
```

*

## Random Notes

```
Here I would document what have I learned, what I need to learn and which concepts to include here,
any information I could not decide yet to segregate would first come here. 
like the title says, Random stuff.
