## General Information
```
 A Project where I try to explain as much as I can about Java(Personal storage of concepts for myself and anyone who finds it)
```

* This is a project I am creating to revise java concepts and to refer whenever I needed to brush up any concept of java in the future. 
    If it helps anyone else and If anyone likes to contribute, I gladly welcome them.
    Note: I am starting to shape the project based on below mentioned links, at least in the beginning stage of the project, I would always add the links I have referred. 

* I have divided the project into two main packages which themselves have child packages based on the different areas covered in the project.
    * myjava
    * advancedjava

## When to use?
```
Here I would try to document which concept of java would be suitable for the real life scenario.
