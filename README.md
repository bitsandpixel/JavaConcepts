# JavaConcepts
A Project where I try to explain as much as I can about Java(Personal storage of concepts for myself and anyone who finds it)

This is a project I am creating to comeback to reference java concepts whenever I needed in the future. 
If it helps anyone else and If anyone likes to contribute, I gladly welcome them.
Note: I am starting to shape the project based on the oops concept provided in the below mentioned link, atleast in the beginning stage of the project, I would always add the links I have referred.
