# Lambda Basics

### WHY Lambdas
    * Enables Functional Programming
    * Readable and concise code(eliminates boilerplate code)
    * Enables us to write better and easier-to-use APIs and libraries
    * Enables support for parallel processing
    * Lambdas lets you pass the behaviour(action) as a parameter and we can execute the action.
        These functions, do not belong to the class. There are not methods of a class,
        They are just functions that exist in isolation.
        Those functions can be treated as values. 

    
### Functional Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming
    * Functional programming let us write better, readable and maintainable code.
    * Problems with Object-Oriented Programming
        * Everything is an object
        * All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects.
        *  
    * Functions as values
        * just like data and object can be passed as values to variables in java,
        lambda expressions enables you to allow a block of code as a value to a varibale.
        so wherever the variable goes, the assigned piece of code goes with it.

    
        
    
### What is Type Inference?
    * With Lambda expressions Java compiler doing something called
    "Type Inference".
    (Definition of Type Inference: An inference is an idea or conclusion that's drawn from evidence and reasoning.
    An inference is an educated guess.)
