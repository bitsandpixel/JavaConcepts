# Data Structures

* Stack is a abstract data type, When we talk about abstract data type we only focus on features it provides rather than implementations.
    * features
        * add an element - push
        * remove an element - pop
        * search an element - peak
    * Stack supports a features called LIFO(Last In First Out)
    
* Queue
    * features
        * FIFO(First In First Out)
